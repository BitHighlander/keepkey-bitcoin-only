# KeepKey Bitcoin-Only Vault Build System
#
# Main targets:
#   make vault        - Build and run vault-v2 in development mode (with keepkey-rust)
#   make vault-build  - Build vault-v2 for production 
#   make vault-dev    - Quick development build (skips dependency checks)
#   make keepkey-rust - Build keepkey-rust library only
#   make clean        - Clean all build artifacts
#   make rebuild      - Clean and rebuild everything
#   make check-deps   - Verify keepkey-rust dependency linking
#   make test-keepkey-rust - Run keepkey-rust tests
#
# Release workflow targets:
#   make release-branch VERSION=2.2.6  - Create release-2.2.6 branch and update version
#   make release-patch-branch          - Auto-increment patch version and create branch
#   make release-minor-branch          - Auto-increment minor version and create branch
#   make release-major-branch          - Auto-increment major version and create branch
#
# Version update only:
#   make release VERSION=2.2.6   - Update version without creating branch
#   make release-patch           - Bump patch version (X.Y.Z+1)
#   make release-minor           - Bump minor version (X.Y+1.0)
#   make release-major           - Bump major version (X+1.0.0)
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Rust/Cargo (for keepkey-rust and Tauri backend)
#   - Bun (for frontend dependencies)
#   - jq (for dependency verification)
