# PERSISTENT BUG 01: PIN Setup Dialog Failure

## Bug Summary
Failed to show PIN creation dialog after PIN is disabled. Device is ready to receive PIN input but UI fails to display the PIN entry interface.

## Status
- **Severity**: Critical
- **First Reported**: Attempt 1
- **Current Attempt**: 8
- **Status**: RESOLVED (Attempt 8)

## Problem Description
When attempting to set up a PIN on a KeepKey device that has PIN protection disabled:
1. User clicks "Set PIN" button
2. Backend successfully initiates PIN setup session
3. Device enters PIN entry mode (ready to receive input)
4. **FAILURE**: Frontend fails to display PIN entry dialog
5. Error: "Failed to start PIN setup: Failure: Unknown message"

## Console Output Pattern
```
[Log] [PinSetupDialog] Starting PIN setup for device: "343737340F4736331F003B00"
[Log] [PinSetupDialog] Received pin_matrix_request event
[Log] [PinSetupDialog] PIN setup session started: "50c19d28-c3a6-4470-81a8-63cd624b32c5"
[Error] [PinSetupDialog] Failed to start PIN setup: "Failed to start PIN setup: Failure: Unknown message"
```

## Technical Analysis

### What's Working
- Device communication is functional
- PIN setup session initiates correctly
- Device enters PIN matrix mode
- Event listeners are properly configured
- pin_matrix_request events are received

### What's Failing
- PinSetupDialog component fails to render the PIN input interface
- Error occurs after session starts but before UI renders
- "Unknown message" error suggests protocol mismatch or missing handler

## Root Cause Analysis

### FINDING: Device Firmware Issue
The device is returning a `Failure` message with "Unknown message" when we send the `ChangePin` command. This indicates:

1. **The device doesn't recognize the ChangePin message format**
   - Message type is correct (MessageType 4)
   - Structure is correct (`remove: Some(false)`)
   - But device firmware responds with "Unknown message"

2. **Inconsistent Backend Implementations**
   - `enable_pin_protection` command expects `Success` response directly
   - `start_pin_setup` expects `ButtonRequest` â†’ `PinMatrixRequest` flow
   - Device is rejecting the message before any flow can start

3. **The UI code is actually working correctly**
   - Event listeners are properly set up
   - State transitions are coded correctly
   - Dialog would render if it received the proper events
   - But backend fails before events can be emitted

## Key Files Involved
- `/src/components/Settings/PinSetupDialog.tsx` - Main dialog component
- `/src/components/Settings/PinSettings.tsx` - Settings toggle component
- `/src/contexts/DialogContext.tsx` - Dialog management system
- `/src-tauri/src/handlers/pin.rs` - Backend PIN handler

## Attempted Solutions (Failed)

### Attempt 1-3: Basic Setup
- Added PIN setup dialog and basic event handling
- Result: Dialog not showing

### Attempt 4-5: Event Handling
- Enhanced event listener setup
- Added pin_matrix_request handling
- Result: Events received but dialog still not showing

### Attempt 6: Session Management
- Added session tracking
- Improved state management
- Result: Session starts but UI fails to render

### Attempt 7: Current State
- Dialog receives events
- Session ID generated
- Still fails with "Unknown message" error

### Attempt 8: SOLUTION FOUND
- **Root Cause**: React StrictMode causing duplicate calls to `start_pin_setup`
- **Issue**: First call succeeds and emits `pin_matrix_request`, second call fails with "Unknown message"
- **Problem**: Error from second call overwrites the successful state transition
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Prevent duplicate initialization calls
  2. Ignore "Unknown message" errors (device already in PIN mode)
  3. Prevent step regression from 'new_pin' back to 'error'
  4. Add safeguards against React StrictMode double-mounting

## Solution Hypothesis

The device is rejecting the `ChangePin` message with "Unknown message" error. This could mean:

1. **Device State Issue**
   - Device might need to be in a specific state to accept ChangePin
   - May need to check if device is initialized first
   - Could require a different message sequence

2. **Protocol Version Mismatch**
   - The device firmware might use a different protocol version
   - ChangePin message format might have changed
   - Need to verify device firmware version and capabilities

3. **Alternative Implementation Needed**
   - Instead of using `ChangePin` directly, might need to use a different flow
   - Could use the initialization flow with PIN setup
   - May need to use `ResetDevice` or `RecoveryDevice` with PIN parameter

## Immediate Fix to Try

1. **Check Device Initialization State**
   - Verify if device is fully initialized before attempting PIN setup
   - Check if device has a seed/mnemonic set up

2. **Try Alternative Message Sequence**
   - Use `GetFeatures` to check device state
   - If not initialized, use `ResetDevice` with PIN
   - If initialized, investigate why `ChangePin` fails

3. **Debug Firmware Compatibility**
   - Log device firmware version
   - Check if firmware supports ChangePin message
   - Look for firmware-specific PIN setup requirements

## Environment
- Framework: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Tauri (Rust)
- Device: KeepKey hardware wallet
- Current Branch: feature-passphrase

## Related Issues
- Passphrase protection is working correctly
- Other dialogs (wipe, passphrase) function properly
- Issue is specific to PIN setup when PIN is disabled

## Notes
- The device IS ready for PIN input - this is purely a UI rendering issue
- The backend-device communication is working
- The problem is in the frontend state management and dialog rendering
