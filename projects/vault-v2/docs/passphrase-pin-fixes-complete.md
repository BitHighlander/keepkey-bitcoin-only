# Complete Summary of Passphrase and PIN Flow Fixes

## Overview
Fixed critical issues preventing proper PIN recognition and passphrase dialog display in the KeepKey Vault v2 application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PIN Recognition Failure ("Unexpected message" error)
**Root Cause**: The `get_device_status` function was sending `GetFeatures` and `Initialize` commands while the device was waiting for `PinMatrixAck`, which reset the device's state machine.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added PIN flow state checking in `get_device_status` 
- When device is in PIN flow, use cached state instead of sending commands
- Protected the device's PIN entry state from interruption

### 2. Passphrase Dialog Not Appearing After PIN
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
1. `send_pin_matrix_ack` wasn't emitting passphrase request events
2. `trigger_pin_request` wasn't handling already-unlocked devices
3. `useDeviceInteraction` hook wasn't mounted in the app

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added passphrase event emission when device responds with `PassphraseRequest`
- Fixed `trigger_pin_request` to emit passphrase events for already-unlocked devices  
- Mounted `useDeviceInteraction` hook in App component
- Created `DevicePinDialog` component for PIN entry during operations

### 3. Empty PIN Submission During Settings Changes
**Root Cause**: The `enable_passphrase_protection_v2` function wasn't properly tracking whether passphrase was being enabled or disabled, causing `handle_pin_response` to always assume enabling.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `pending_passphrase_setting` field to `DeviceSession` struct
- Track enable/disable state when starting passphrase settings change
- Use tracked state in `handle_pin_response` to determine correct reconnect reason

## Technical Details

### Modified Files:
1. **src-tauri/src/commands.rs**
   - Added PIN flow protection in `get_device_status`
   - Added passphrase event emission in `send_pin_matrix_ack` and `trigger_pin_request`
   - Fixed `pin_submit` to accept string request IDs
   - Track passphrase enable/disable state in device session

2. **src-tauri/src/event_controller.rs**
   - Added PIN flow check before OOB bootloader detection

3. **src-tauri/src/device/interaction_state.rs**
   - Added `pending_passphrase_setting` field to track settings changes

4. **src/App.tsx**
   - Added `useDeviceInteraction` hook to enable global device interaction handling

5. **src/hooks/useDeviceInteraction.ts**
   - Updated dialog IDs to be unique per device/request
   - Added lazy loading for DevicePinDialog component

6. **src/components/DevicePinDialog.tsx** (new)
   - Created PIN entry dialog component with visual matrix
   - Handles PIN submission via `pin_submit` command
   - Shows operation-specific descriptions

## Testing Results
- ✅ PIN entry no longer fails with "Unexpected message"
- ✅ Passphrase dialog appears after successful PIN entry
- ✅ PIN dialog appears when changing passphrase settings
- ✅ Correct passphrase enable/disable state is tracked and applied

## Impact
These fixes ensure proper authentication flow for KeepKey devices with both PIN and passphrase protection enabled. Users can now:
- Successfully enter their PIN without errors
- See the passphrase dialog when needed
- Change passphrase settings with proper PIN verification
