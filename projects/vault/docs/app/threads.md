Below is a deeper dive into the “background watcher + events” pattern—why it works, what pieces you need on each side, and several production-grade refinements.

1 Why a detached watcher unblocks the UI
Tauri’s event-loop thread owns the WebView. Anything that runs on that thread (default for commands) pauses HTML/CSS/JS paint.

Spawning a separate thread (or Tokio task) lets heavy USB work happen in parallel.
The watcher thread sends lightweight JSON payloads back to the UI through AppHandle::emit_all, which is non-blocking for the sender and just queues the message for the main loop to dispatch.

Result: the window paints immediately, and you still get near-real-time device updates.

2 Rust side – a robust watcher
2.1 Minimal working example
rust
Copy
Edit
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
use tauri::{AppHandle, Manager};
use keepkey_usb::get_device_features_impl; // your code
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Serialize, Clone)]
struct DeviceEvent {
connected: bool,
features: Option<DeviceFeatures>,
}

pub fn spawn_usb_watcher(app: AppHandle) {
thread::spawn(move || {
let mut last_connected = false;
loop {
let current = match get_device_features_impl() {
Ok(f) => Some(f),
Err(_) => None,
};

            let connected = current.is_some();
            // Emit only on state change OR every N seconds (your pick)
            if connected != last_connected {
                let evt = DeviceEvent {
                    connected,
                    features: current.clone(),
                };
                app.emit_all("usb:features", evt).ok();
                last_connected = connected;
            }
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
}
Add it once during startup:

rust
Copy
Edit
tauri::Builder::default()
.setup(|app| {
spawn_usb_watcher(app.handle());
Ok(())
})
.plugin(tauri_plugin_log::init())
.run(tauri::generate_context!())?;
2.2 Graceful shutdown (optional)
AppHandle becomes invalid after the event loop quits, so the thread should exit too:

rust
Copy
Edit
let app_id = app.id().to_string();
thread::spawn(move || {
while tauri::async_runtime::block_on(app.try_state::<()>().is_some()) {
/* ... */
}
});
In practice most devs skip this—when the main window closes the process exits and the thread dies.

2.3 Hot-plug instead of polling
Linux & Windows: rusb ≥ 0.10 exposes register_callback / open_device_with_vid_pid to receive LIBUSB_HOTPLUG_EVENT_DEVICE_ARRIVED / LEFT.

macOS: IOKit hot-plug is trickier; polling every 0.5–1 s is fine—USB enumeration is cheap when nothing changed.

Wrap hot-plug callbacks in an mpsc/broadcast channel and forward to emit_all.

3 React side – listening once
ts
Copy
Edit
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { listen } from "@tauri-apps/api/event";

useEffect(() => {
const unlisten = await listen("usb:features", ({ payload }) => {
const evt = payload as { connected: boolean, features: DeviceFeatures | null };
if (evt.connected) {
setDeviceInfo({ features: evt.features!, error: null });
} else {
setDeviceInfo({ features: null, error: "Disconnected" });
}
});

return () => { unlisten(); };
}, []);
No invoke at mount time → first paint is instant.
If you want an immediate status before the first event arrives, emit once from Rust at startup or keep a short fallback setTimeout that calls invoke("get_device_info") only if no event has arrived within (say) 500 ms.

4 Production refinements
Concern	Tweak
CPU wakeups	Increase sleep() to 2000 ms on idle; shorten to 250 ms while a device is connected.
Multiple devices	Maintain HashMap<device_id, DeviceFeatures> and emit arrays.
Structured errors	Emit { kind: "hid-permission", message: "...", features: null } so UI can show guided troubleshooting.
Thread-safe shared state	Arc<Mutex<DeviceManager>> if other commands need to act on the same handle (e.g., “flash firmware”).
Tokio runtime	Inside setup, start tokio::spawn(async move { … }) instead of a bare thread::spawn if you already depend on tokio (Tauri 2.0 has built-in).
Logs	Replace println! with log::info! so tauri_plugin_log funnels them to dev console and rotating files in prod.

5 Mental checklist
Never do blocking I/O inside a command unless wrapped in spawn_blocking.

Prefer events for state that changes autonomously (USB hot-plug, WebSocket updates).

Use JSON-serializable structs (#[derive(Serialize)]) for payloads; Tauri serialises them to JS objects.

Throttle or debounce rapid events on the Rust side to avoid flooding the bridge.

TL;DR
A detached watcher thread (or async task) continuously watches the USB bus, then pushes updates to the frontend with emit_all. Because all heavy work is off the main loop, the WebView becomes interactive immediately and stays responsive, while the UI still reflects device state in near real time.
