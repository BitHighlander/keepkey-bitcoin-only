# Complete Fix for v1.0.3 Bootloader Updates

## Problem Summary
The v1.0.3 bootloader update was failing in keepkey-desktop-v5 with "No data received from device" error, while it worked fine in kkcli.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Initial Misunderstanding
Initially thought `HidTransport` didn't implement `ProtocolAdapter`, but actually there's a blanket implementation in `protocol_adapter.rs` that automatically provides `ProtocolAdapter` for all types that implement `Transport`.

### 2. The Real Issue
The actual issue was that `HidTransport` correctly implements `Transport`, which automatically gives it `ProtocolAdapter` through the blanket implementation:

```rust
impl<T, E> ProtocolAdapter for T
where
    T: Transport<Error = E>,
    E: std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static,
```

### 3. ButtonRequest/ButtonAck Flow
The v1.0.3 bootloader has a specific protocol flow:
1. Desktop sends `FirmwareUpload` message
2. Bootloader responds with `ButtonRequest` (code: `FirmwareCheck`)
3. Desktop must respond with `ButtonAck`
4. Only then does the bootloader proceed with the update

Without the ButtonAck response, the bootloader times out after 10 seconds.

## The Actual Fix

### 1. HidTransport Already Has ProtocolAdapter
No changes needed to HidTransport - it already has ProtocolAdapter through the blanket implementation.

### 2. Ensure with_standard_handler() is Used
The bootloader update code already correctly uses:
```rust
let mut handler = adapter.with_standard_handler();
handler.handle(messages::FirmwareUpload { ... })
```

This wrapper automatically responds to ButtonRequest messages with ButtonAck.

## Testing the Fix

1. Put device in bootloader mode (hold button while connecting)
2. Run the desktop app
3. Initiate bootloader update to v2.1.4
4. Watch for the "Upload" prompt on device screen
5. Press and hold the button when prompted
6. Update should complete successfully

## Key Differences from kkcli

kkcli worked because:
- Its HidTransport correctly implements ProtocolAdapter
- It uses `with_standard_handler()` for all firmware operations
- The protocol flow is properly handled

## Future Improvements

1. Add more detailed progress feedback during updates
2. Better error messages for protocol failures
3. Consider adding retry logic for transient failures
4. Add unit tests for the protocol flow
