## Installation

(Instructions for installing prerequisites, if any)

## Building

To build the KeepKey CLI, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed. You can find installation instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, navigate to the project root directory and run:

```bash
cargo build
```

For a release build, use:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Running

After building the project, you can run the CLI using:

```bash
cargo run -- <command> [options]
```

Replace `<command>` with the desired command and `[options]` with any necessary options.

For example, to see the help information:

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

If you built a release version, the executable will be located at `target/release/kkcli`. You can run it directly:

```bash
./target/release/kkcli <command> [options]
```
