🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide: Tauri to Microsoft Store (via MSIX)
✅ 1. Create a Microsoft Developer Account
Go here:
👉 https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/signup

Cost: $19 (individual) or $99 (company), one-time.

You’ll need:

Microsoft login (Outlook/Live/etc.)

Basic contact info

Bank info (if you want to sell apps)

✅ 2. Build Your Tauri App
On Windows (required for MSIX tools):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run tauri build
This generates:

src-tauri/target/release/bundle

Inside, you'll see nsis, msi, or exe — but we will wrap it manually into MSIX.

Keep note of the output path, e.g.:

bash
Copy
Edit
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/YourApp-setup.exe
✅ 3. Install the MSIX Packaging Tool
Download from Microsoft Store (on Windows 10+):
👉 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msix-packaging-tool/9n5lw3jbcxkf

Alternatively, install via PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
winget install --id Microsoft.MsixPackagingTool
✅ 4. Prepare Your App for MSIX
You need a clean app folder, not an .exe installer. So:

A. Create a folder for packaging
Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\MyTauriAppPackage
B. Copy your built app here
From:

swift
Copy
Edit
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/YourApp.exe
Or if you have an unpackaged .app folder, use that instead (preferred).

C. Create a shortcut (optional but helps with UX)
Create a shortcut inside C:\MyTauriAppPackage pointing to your .exe.

Name it something like Launch YourApp.lnk.

✅ 5. Run the MSIX Packaging Tool
Open MSIX Packaging Tool

Select: "Application package" → "Create new package"

Choose “Manual packaging”

Fill in:

Package Name: e.g., com.keepkey.wallet

Publisher Display Name: Your name/company

Version: 1.0.0.0

Installation Folder: Select your C:\MyTauriAppPackage

Choose where to save .msix (e.g., Desktop)

Click Create

✅ 6. Upload to Microsoft Store
Go to: https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard

In the "Product Overview" tab:

Click Create a new app

Fill in:

Name

Category

Pricing (free or paid)

Upload your .msix under Packages

Fill out:

Description

Screenshots

Capabilities (declare internetClient, etc.)

Submit

Microsoft will sign the app for you during review.

✅ 7. Wait for Certification & Go Live
Microsoft reviews take 1–5 business days.

Once live, you get a Microsoft Store link like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFJ3Q8
✅ 8. Share the Store Link — No Warnings
Users get:

✅ No SmartScreen blocks

✅ One-click install via trusted source

✅ Automatic updates

🧩 Optional: Use AppInstaller for Web Installs (Optional)
If you want to offer a direct web install link:

Create a .appinstaller XML pointing to your .msix.

Host both files on your domain.

Users can install via browser with one click (requires HTTPS + signed app).

Let me know if you want this too — I’ll give you a .appinstaller template.
